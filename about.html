      <h3>Who is Jame?</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        I know you wouldn't have expected this, but my real name is actually James. I grew up for the most part in Kentucky, but I've lived all around the eastern coast of 
        the US (both parents were military). I've picked up and dropped lots of hobbies in my lifetime but the one that has stuck with me the longest has been playing
        video games. One of my favorite memories from my childhood is watching my dad play Halo 2 when he had a day off from work - I specifically remember the part during 
        the Metropolis mission after you cross the bridge and exit the tunnel. I was mesmerized by the level design at the time.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        My experience with playing games and watching other people play games has shaped a lot of who I am today. From making life long friendships to finding a deep appreciation
        for game design and the curation of interactable experinces, the social, emotional, and physical aspects of video games and their creative process have fashioned a set of 
        entertainment-tinted lenses in which I view the world and what I can deliver to it.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        "Wow this guy likes video games."
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        No, I do not <em>like</em> video games; I <strong><em>love</em></strong> video games.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 14px;">
        So much so that I want to make video games for other people to love, to build friendships around, to learn from, to hyper fixate on, to use as a creative outlet or 
        inspiration for their own game development endeavors.

      <p style="background-color: #d8c4ac; font-weight: bold; padding-left: 8px;">Dream Job</p>
      <ul>
        <p style="font-size: 14px;">
          I would do almost anything to be a jack-of-all-trades Technical Artist. I'm a self taught pixel artist and animator 
          and I love programming. The whole visual pipeline and asset creation process is fascinating to me and I like to think I have an eye for it. 
          At the end of it all, I would <strong><em>really</em></strong> like to be the founder of my own indie game studio.
